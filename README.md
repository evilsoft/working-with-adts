## Working With Algebraic Data Types in Javascript

This repo is used to curate the code that goes along with a live coding series that can be [found here](http://bit.ly/adts-playlist). Each session has its own branch associated to it. To follow along at home, just checkout the branch you are currently watching and have a play with the code.

In this series, we explore different approaches to using ADTs to solve various problems that arise in typical Javascript development. To keep the flow focused, we opt to implement a trivial card guessing game. While the game itself is a little silly, the implementation provides a lot of interesting problems that when solved using ADTs, exposing some fun uses of these things.

The ADT library we are using this series is called `crocks` and can be [found here](https://github.com/evilsoft/crocks).

### Install

Clone this repo onto your local system, navigate to the folder and run:

```
$ npm install
```

This will install the dependencies for this project. After that finishes, you should be good to go.

### Usage

Each recorded live session has a branch associated to it. To follow along you can check out the previous branch of the one you are current on, and you will be in the same starting point of the video you are on.

Below is a table that matches the sessions to their respective branches:

|Session|Branch|Command|
|-|-|-|
|[Functional JS - Working with ADTs - 01](http://bit.ly/adts-01)|[adts-01](https://github.com/evilsoft/working-with-adts/tree/adts-01)|`git checkout adts-01`|
|[Functional JS - Working with ADTs - 02](http://bit.ly/adts-02)|[adts-02](https://github.com/evilsoft/working-with-adts/tree/adts-02)|`git checkout adts-02`|

#### Run the code

To get started running some code, just run the following in the project root:

```
$ npm start
```

Now just edit the `index.js` file in the roots, and your code will be executed on each save.
